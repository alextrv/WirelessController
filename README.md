# Wireless Controller

Wireless Controller is an app that provides Wi-Fi control.
It periodically auto-enables Wi-Fi and checks if saved networks are
available and then connect to them, otherwise the app disables Wi-Fi
for power saving. User can set white list of saved networks to connect only to them.
There are automatic rules that user can set up to disable Wi-Fi auto-enabling for
some range of time. App also can auto-disable Bluetooth if it's enabled.
All of these actions are optional and can be enabled/disabled by user.
